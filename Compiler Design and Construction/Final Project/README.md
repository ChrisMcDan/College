For a more detailed description of what this project entailed, please view the "TranslatorLab" document above.

The following description of the options match with the letter and number of the file name above: "C1", "C2", etc.

“C” Option:  
  1)	For the “C” option compute ans = a * ((Bob +Jane -10) /2 * 4)/ (b + c).  Read values for a, b, c, Bob, and Jane from the terminal and print the result.  
    2)	For a simple, read two integers from the terminal and print the largest value.  
    3)	For the nested if, read three integers from the terminal and print the largest.  
    4)	Compute N! using a “while” or “for” loop.  Read the value of N from the terminal and print the result.  If you nest for loops, place your factorial calculation in a loop           for M iterations.  M should be read from the terminal.  N! is defined as N*(N-1)! For N > 1.  0! And 1! both equal 1 by definition.  
“B” Option Territory:  
    5)	Repeat #4 for the while and nested while statements.  
    6)	Calculate N! using a function.  Use a for or while loop to do the actual calculation.  All input should be from the keyboard and results placed on the display device in           the main program.  
“A” Option Territory:  
    7)	Calculate N! using a recursive function.  All input should be from the keyboard and results placed on the display device in the main program.  
    8)  Exhibit any programs required to show special features of your translator such as CBV or CBR.
