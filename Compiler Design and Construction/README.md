# COSC 4316

This course deals with the design and implementation of assemblers, interpreters and compilers.
Topics include symbol tables, lexical scanning, syntactic analysis, object code generation and storage allocation.

The "Final Project" was the only project we had the entire semester. The project had me incorporate everything we learned
in this class and from the Data Structures and Algorithms class.
