# COSC 1437

This course focuses on the object-oriented programming paradigm, emphasizing the definition
and use of classes along with fundamentals of object-oriented design.
This course includes basic analysis of algorithms, searching and sorting techniques
and an introduction to software engineering processes. Students will apply techniques for testing and debugging software.

Identify and explain a programming development life-cycle, including planning, analysis, design, development, and maintenance.
Demonstrate a basic understanding of object-oriented programming by using structures (structs) and classes in software projects.
Use object-oriented programming techniques to develop executable programs that include elements such as inheritance and polymorphism.
Document and format code in a consistent manner. Apply basic searching an sorting algorithms in software design.
Apply single-and multi-dimensional arrays in software. Use a symbolic debugger to find and fix run-time and logical errors in software.
