Students are introduced to instruction set architectures, emphasizing central processor organization and operations.
Specific topics may include data representations, register architectures, addressing modes, the fetch/ execute cycle;
interrupts, subprogram calls, I/O services, digital logic gates and basic Boolean algebra, and sequential and combinational circuits.
Programs are assigned in a representative assembly language to explore these areas.
